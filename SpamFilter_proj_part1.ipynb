No late submissions beyond what is outlined in the Slip Day policy will be accepted. We strongly encourage you to plan to submit your work to Gradescope several hours before the stated deadline. This way, you will have ample time to reach out to staff for support if you encounter difficulties with submission. While course staff is happy to help guide you with submitting your assignment ahead of the deadline, we will not respond to last-minute requests for assistance (TAs need to sleep, after all!).\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "You will use what you've learned in class to create a binary classifier that can distinguish spam (junk, commercial, or bulk) emails from ham (regular non-spam) emails. In addition to providing some skeleton code to fill in, we will evaluate your work based on your model's accuracy and your written responses in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this project, you should feel comfortable with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feature engineering with text data.\n",
    "- Using the `sklearn` library to process data and fit models.\n",
    "- Validating the performance of your model and minimizing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "This first part of the project focuses on initial analysis, feature engineering, and logistic regression. In the second part of this project (which will be released next week), you will build your own spam/ham classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Content Warning\n",
    "This is a **real-world** dataset —— the emails you are trying to classify are actual spam and legitimate emails. As a result, some of the spam emails may be in poor taste or be considered inappropriate. We think the benefit of working with realistic data outweighs these inappropriate emails but wanted to provide a warning at the beginning of the project so that you are aware.\n",

If the $j$-th word in `words` is present at least once in the $i$-th email in `texts`, the output array should have a value of 1 at the position $(i, j)$. Otherwise, if the $j$-th word is not present in the $i$-th email, the value at $(i, j)$ should be 0.\n",

In future parts of this analysis, we will make use of the data we held out for model validation and comparison.\n",

The number of points classifed correctly is the number of true postive and true negatives, or inversely the number of emails minus the ones incorrectly classified, the number of false postives and false negatives. So then the accuracy I said was the total number of emails minus the ones incorrectly classified, all over the total number of emails. zero_predictor_recall is the proportion of spam correctly flagged as spam, number of true postive over the number of true postive plus false negatives.

    "I would rather use the my_model legistic regression classifer because it has a better recall rate, or rather more spam emails were correctly identified as spam by my_model than the zero-predictor. Because it's for a spam filter, we want a high recall, or high sensitivity to actual postive (spam) observations, and my_model has a higher recall/sensitivity by virtue of identifying spam in the first place, while the zero-predictor never identifies anything as spam. This also means that the zero-predictor has a percision of 0, since in never correctly has true postives, while my_model has a higher precision of 0.64, so it's a better model in correctly identifying only spam as spam. So then my_model seems to be the better choice for a spam filter in all because it's higher recall and precision."
